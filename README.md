# Antigravity Devcontainer Template

This repository serves as a robust template for creating Antigravity-compatible Devcontainers, specifically designed to resolve common connectivity and installation issues found in recent versions (e.g., 1.18.x).

## The Problem

Users often encounter the following issues when trying to set up a Devcontainer with Antigravity:

1. **Configuration Errors**: `devcontainer.json` complaining about missing properties like `dockerComposeFile`.
2. **Stalled Containers**: The container starts but stalls during initialization due to incorrect volume mounting (mounting the parent directory instead of the project root), leading to massive indexing overhead.
3. **Server Installation Failures**: The IDE fails to connect because the remote server binary isn't installed automatically. This is often caused by:
* Missing dependencies (like `wget`) in the Docker image.
* Automatic installation scripts failing silently or attempting to download from incorrect URLs.



## The Solution

This template implements a multi-layered fix to ensure a smooth "Reopen in Container" experience:

### 1. Corrected Configuration

* **`devcontainer.json`**: Explicitly links to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* **`docker-compose.yml`**:
* **Volume Mount**: Corrects the mount to `.:/workspace` (current directory) to prevent indexing unrelated files.
* **Startup Command**: Overrides the default command to execute a custom server installation script before sleeping.



### 2. Dependency Management

* **`Dockerfile`**: Includes `wget`, `iproute2`, `netbase`, and other essential utilities to ensure the server installation script can download the necessary binaries and establish networking tunnels.

### 3. Manual Server Installation

* **`server-install.sh`**: A robust script that:
* Detects if the Antigravity server is missing.
* Downloads the specific, compatible version of the server (e.g., 1.18.3) from a verified URL.
* Installs it to the correct location (`/root/.antigravity-server`).
* Ensures correct permissions.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Error 127 & Startup Issues

If the container hangs at "Starting Remote Server" or throws **Error 127**, it typically means the Antigravity agent is missing a low-level system dependency required for its internal Node.js runtime or networking tunnel.

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Error 127** during port forward | The forwarder cannot find the `ip` command. | Ensure `iproute2` is installed in the Dockerfile. |
| **Silent Crash** on terminal open | Node.js is missing atomic memory libraries. | Ensure `libatomic1` is installed (crucial for `slim` images). |
| **Connection Refused** | Missing network protocol definitions. | Ensure `netbase` is installed (provides `/etc/services`). |
| **Agent Won't Start** | A stale installation lock exists. | Run `rm -f /root/.antigravity-server/.installation_lock`. |

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** (or use it as a template).
2. **Open in Antigravity**.
3. **Reopen in Container**: The setup will automatically:
* Build the Docker image.
* Start the container.
* Run `server-install.sh` to setup the remote server.
* Connect the IDE successfully.
* **Pro-Tip**: You can verify the installation progress by running `docker logs <container_id>` to see the output of `server-install.sh`.
